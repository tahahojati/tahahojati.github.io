        <p>
           I'm a lover of learning and a seeker of truth! I also do software development as my day job.  I have a B.S. in Physics from U. of Hawaii.  While studying, I realized that I really enjoyed coding and working with electronics, so after graduating I taught myself web development using books and online resources.  I am lucky because software and algorithm design are skills that just feel natural to me.  Some days I sit down and read a technical book for hours on like it is Harry Potter. I am also lucky because many folks decided to trust my skills when I had no proven track of experience and put me in charge of their application.  Thanks to them, I was able to become a better Developer.  
        </p>
        <p>

            These days I am trying to orient myself towards the more data-centeric side of computer science.  I am quite interested in topics like AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and big data analysis and am actively educating myself in those fields.  At the same time, I am still working on my skills as an application/web developer.  I have done a few simple Android apps as personal projects, I am contributing to a Code for America project here in Hawaii and I am the proud webmaster of my church! I am also working on couple other "secret" personal projects at the moment.  If I ever complete them, I'll share a link here! haha

        </p>

            When I was 18, I chose to study physics because I wanted to make an impact in the world.  I needed to gain an understanding and make a difference (and hopefully some profit!)  Today, that is still my primary desire and motivation.  It makes me a little restless and inpatient but I also believe that it gives me the ability to always keep the big picture in mind and the courage to take risks and dedicate myself to projects.  If you are somebody who feels the same way and are looking for a partner, please contact me :)

            I moved to Hawaii in 2010.  Here, I graduated from Kaiser high school and attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa in pursuit of a BS. in physics.  In my freshman and sophomore years in UHM, I worked in a bioinformatics lab as an assistant analyst. During that time, It was my privilege to design and maintain a MySQL database of genetic elements and to create a public front end for it
            using server-side programming with PHP language on an Apache web server.
            I recently graduated and am now looking for a full time job!
</p>
<p>
            I learned programming with C++ in 9th grade. I loved (and still love) to solve algorithm design problems using programming. Since then, I've learned (and in some cases forgot) many computer languages including PHP, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, Matlab, javascript, and R. Now I am looking for a way to use my skills as a programmer and designer in the market. To that purpose, I completed an online degree on Udacity.com focused on Front-End web development a while ago. Since then, I've been reading books and programming full time to accumulate the experience that I display in this portfolio.  During this time, I have improved a lot. I am proud that I know my way around working with Angular and Zend Framework.  Also, at this moment, I am learning agile development using Ruby on Rails just to become a better software developer.</p>
            <p>

            When I am not coding, I am usually reading, playing tennis and ping-pong, or more likely playing video games.

        <p>
            I made these pages using AngularJS and Bootstrap CSS framework.  It only took me around 12 hours to make from start to finish, and I wrote every line of code by hand!  Putting on all of the screen-shots and typing all of the content took an especially long time.
